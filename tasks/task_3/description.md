## **__TASK 3__**
**Python syntax: for loops and if statements.**

### **INTENTIONS & GOALS**
> The main goal of this task is to get you familiar with the Python syntax and the basic data structures and algorithms.
> This task focuses on the basic data structure `list`, for loops and python operators. 

> Don't worry if your code is perfect or optimized yet. That's something we will worry about later. Now the only focus
> is to get into the workflow of writing code and to get familiar with the syntax.

### **REQUIREMENTS**:
> - Create a new python file in your path of choice and name it `task_3.py`.
> - Create a `readme.md` file which describes what your script (task and goal) and repository is about. 
> - Create a `requirements.txt` file which contains all the dependencies of your script. (In this one, we don't have any)
>> - If you can, use [Markdown markup language](https://markdown-it.github.io) or just write into the 
> file as if it would be a `.txt` file. 

### **TASK**:
> Given is a list called `community_members` with names of our members 
> (as `string`) in it. All members which have at least the letter "a" 1x 
> in should be filtered and stored in a new list variable. 
> Return the total number of entries of that list. 
> Use the list variable in the file `task_3.py`

**EXAMPLE**:
```
❌ "long" does not include the letter "a"
✅ "blazertherazer12" does include the letter "a" twice.
✅ "bakucoco" does include the letter "a" once.

# example code
if "a" in example_string: 
  # < do-something-with example_string >
```
