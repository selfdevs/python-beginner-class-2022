# **__TASK 4__**  - **Python syntax: functions in list comprehenions**
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.


## Requirements
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing different technologies. 
However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.


## Installation
Describe how to install your script. In this case it's just installing the requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Describe how to use your script. In this case it's just running the main.py file.

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
```bash
python3 task_4.py
```


## Project Status
If you are still working on your project, you can write down what you are currently working on and what you are planning to do next.


## Challenges & Learnings
Here you can write down what you have learned and what resources you used just for future references.
Other's can learn from them too.


## Contributing
Here you can define if other's can and should contribute to your project.
