## **__TASK 2__**
**Python syntax: for loops and if statements.**

### **INTENTIONS & GOALS**
> The main goal of this task is to get you familiar with the Python syntax and the basic data structures and algorithms.
> This task focuses on the for loop and the if statement.

> Don't worry if your code is perfect or optimized yet. That's something we will worry about later. Now the only focus
> is to get into the workflow of writing code and to get familiar with the syntax.

### **REQUIREMENTS**:
> - Create a new python file in your path of choice and name it `task_2.py`.
> - Create a `readme.md` file which describes what your script (task and goal) and repository is about. 
> - Create a `requirements.txt` file which contains all the dependencies of your script. (In this one, we don't have any)
>> - If you can, use [Markdown markup language](https://markdown-it.github.io) or just write into the 
> file as if it would be a `.txt` file. 

### **TASK**:
> Given is a list between numbers from 0 to 100. All numbers which have a 5 as a digit like: 
> 5, 15, 95 should be counted and stored in a new list variable. Please return the total number of entries in that 
> list and the list itself.**
