## **__TASK 14__**
**Working with panda dataframes and Jupyter Notebooks**

### **INTENTIONS & GOALS**
> To automate processes, you have to learn how to build ETL pipelines in the most efficient way.
> To do that, you need to get in touch with data structures which exceed simple `lists` and `dictionaries`.
> In this class we are going to use the pandas `data frame` to store our data in Python.

> It's one of the most important and key data structures in Python and it's used in almost every data science project.
> It will help you to understand your data better, faster and most importantly, most efficiently.
 
### **Requirements**:
> - create a new virtual environment
> - create a `requirements.txt` file
> - install the most recent package of `Pandas` in your requirements.txt 
> - create a `readme.md` file which describes what your script (task and goal) and repository is about. 
>> - If you can, use [Markdown markup language](https://markdown-it.github.io) or just write into the
> file as if it would be a `.txt` file.
