# SELFDEV - ONLINE PYTHON CLASS
This repository contains all files and resources for the weekly online Python class on our Discord Server.
We currently have 14 tasks which everyone can work on and learn Python together.


## Intention
The goal of this python class is to help you breaking into the world of programming and learn Python from scratch.
We will start with the basics and work our way up to more advanced topics like web scraping, APIs, data analysis and machine learning.
There is no limitation on how fast you can work through the tasks. You can work on them as fast or as slow as you want.
The only thing that matters is that you learn something new and have fun doing it.


## How to get started
If you are new to programming and want to learn Python, you can start with the first task.
If you already have some experience with programming, you can start with the task you feel comfortable with.
